**Project Autonomous Vehicle**
In this project we, a team of 4 students, have developped a solution for a self driven vehicle using a Raspberry-4 and a camera. You will find in this repository a Design and a Flask folder. 
The Flask folder specifies all the python files using Flask in order to control the car using SSH communication.
Moreover a whole calibration of the camera was needed in order for the computer to recognize QR codes that were disposed on a circuit in order for the car to localize itself.
The Design folder specifies the svg file that helped us building and designing the final product which we built.
The Web folder is about the interface we developped for the commands of the car.
